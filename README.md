# Learning Turbulent Flows with Generative Models

**Code for:** “Learning Turbulent Flows with Generative Models: Super-resolution, Forecasting, and Sparse Flow Reconstruction.”

Neural operators are fast surrogates for dynamical systems but, when trained with standard L² losses, they oversmooth fine-scale turbulent structures. This repo explores how **operator learning + generative modeling** restores high-frequency content and improves fidelity on three practical tasks:

- **Spatio-temporal super-resolution**
- **Forecasting**
- **Sparse flow reconstruction**

> **Status:** Under review and actively evolving. **Stay tuned for updates and code releases.** ⭐
