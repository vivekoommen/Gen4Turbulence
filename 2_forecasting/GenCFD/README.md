# GenCFD: Generative AI for CFD

This is the PyTorch based source code for the paper 
[Generative AI for fast and accurate Statistical Computation of Fluids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18359).

### Overview

GenCFD is a PyTorch-based implementation designed for training and evaluating conditional score-based diffusion models for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tasks. These generative AI models enable fast, accurate, and robust statistical computation for simulating both two-dimensional and three-dimensional turbulent fluid flows.

## 🛠️ Installation

To set up a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies for this project, follow these steps.

1) Create a Virtual Environment
```shell
python3 -m venv venv
```

2) Activate the Virtual Environment
```shell
source venv/bin/activate
```

3) Install dependencies: Make sure your virtual environment is active, then run:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4) Optional: Install GenCFD as a library
If you would like to use GenCFD and its functions as a library, you can install it directly from the repository instead of step 3:
```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/camlab-ethz/GenCFD.git@main
```

## 🏋️ Training

Train a model from the root directory by using:
```shell
python3 -m GenCFD.train.train_gencfd \
--dataset <DATASET_NAME> \
--model_type <MODEL_NAME> \
--save_dir <DIRECTORY_PATH> \
--num_train_steps <INT>
```

### Notes:
* `DATASET_NAME` should be a valid dataset from the section Dataset.
* `MODEL_NAME` should either be `PreconditionedDenoiser` for the two-dimensional case, or `PreconditionedDenoiser3D` in the three-dimensional case.
    * 3D models have approximately 70M parameters with (64, 64, 64) resolution.
    * Recommended: GPU with 32GB memory (batch size 5) or 24GB memory (batch size 4).

After training, a JSON file with model settings is saved in the output directory for use during inference.

For a fast training, use a compiled model in parallel:

```shell
torchrun --nproc_per_node=<INT> \
-m GenCFD.train.train_gencfd \
--world_size <INT> \
--dataset <DATASET_NAME> \
--model_type <MODEL_NAME> \
--save_dir <DIRECTORY_PATH> \
--num_train_steps <INT>
--compile
```

The flag `--world_size` determines the size of the group associated with a communicator and it has to correspond to the number of processes 
or trainers used for parallelization. The relevant flag to set this is `--nproc_per_node`. Another advice for fast training is to chooce a 
proper number of workers which can be specified through the flag `--worker`.

## 🧪 Inference and Evaluation

Run inference with:

```shell
python3 -m GenCFD.eval.evaluate_gencfd \
--dataset <DATASET_NAME> \
--model_type <MODEL_NAME> \
--model_dir <DIRECTORY_PATH> \
--compute_metrics \
--monte_carlo_samples <INT> \
--visualize \
--save_gen_samples\
--save_dir <DIRECTORY_PATH>
```

Run inference in parallel:

```shell
torchrun --nproc_per_node=<INT> \
-m GenCFD.eval.evaluate_gencfd \
--world_size <INT> \
--dataset <DATASET_NAME> \
--model_type <MODEL_NAME> \
--model_dir <DIRECTORY_PATH> \
--compute_metrics \
--monte_carlo_samples <INT> \
--visualize \
save_gen_samples \
--save_dir <DIRECTORY_PATH>
```

Also here the number of models spawned should be the same for both flags `--world_size` and `--nproc_per_node`.
It's also possible to compile the model when run in a parallel or a sequential setup.

### Options:

* `--compute_metrics`: Computes evaluation metrics (e.g., mean and standard deviation) using Monte Carlo simulations.
* `--visualize`: Generates a single inference sample for visualization.
* `--save_gen_samples`: Saves randomly selected samples drawn from a uniform distribution

The number of sampling steps (`--sampling_steps`) for the Euler-Maruyama method should be preferably >30 for convergence.

## ⚙️ Summary of Additional Arguments

The following table summarizes key arguments that can help optimize memory usage or fine-tune model performance.

* **Action Arguments**: Simply add the flag (e.g., `--track_memory`), no need to specify `True` or `False`.
* **Boolean Flags**: Requires explicit specification of either `True` or `False` (e.g. `--use_mixed_precision True`)

A compiled version of the model can be used through adding the flag `--compile`. The compiler works without any issues on 
the following GPUs

* NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 
* NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 
* NVIDIA Tesla V100-SXM2 32 GiB 
* NVIDIA Tesla V100-SXM2 32 GB
* Nvidia Tesla A100

If there are some compiler warnings, you can always surpress them.
